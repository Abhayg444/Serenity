# Serenity
Serenity is AI powered chatbot using python , tensorflow, numpy and nltk
Serenity is an AI powered chatbot that is built using the Python programming language, along with the TensorFlow, NumPy, and NLTK libraries.

The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to understand and generate human-like responses. The TensorFlow library is used for building and training the chatbot's neural network, while the NumPy library is used for numerical computations and array manipulation. The NLTK library is used for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.

Serenity can be used for various use cases like customer service, personal assistance, and more. It is designed to understand and respond to user inputs in a conversational manner, and it can also perform tasks such as answering questions, providing information, and completing simple actions.

To use Serenity, you will need to have Python and the above-mentioned libraries installed on your computer. You can then download the chatbot's source code and run it on your local machine. The chatbot can be trained on new data to improve its performance and accuracy.
